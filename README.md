# OS-Forecast

The OSforecast function performs a one-step-ahead out-of-sample forecast using an expanding window regression approach. It forecasts a time series variable y based on predictor variables x, beginning with a specified in-sample period (isper) and updating the regression model as new data becomes available. At each step, it estimates regression coefficients using all data available up to that point and then forecasts the next value of y. The result is a sequence of out-of-sample forecasts (fy). The function evaluates forecasting performance using standard metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Theilâ€™s U statistic (U) for relative forecast accuracy, and Out-of-Sample R-squared (OSR2), which compares forecast error variance to a simple benchmark like the historical mean. This method is commonly used in time series analysis to test the predictive power of economic or financial models in a realistic, evolving-data setting.
